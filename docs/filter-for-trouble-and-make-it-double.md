# ðŸ§  Filter for trouble, and make it double!

Now we can search for a specific specie but it would be better to be able to filter the list and
display species of a given type.

The API allows to filter the species retrieved by the `GET /species` endpoint (see the
[endpoint documentation](https://www.pokedexercice.ch/documentation/get/species)). Update your code
to allow users to use this feature.
